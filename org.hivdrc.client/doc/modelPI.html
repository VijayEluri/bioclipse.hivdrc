<h2>Protease Inhibitor model</h2>

This proteochemometric model is described in 
Lapins et al., BMC Bioinformatics (2008) 9:181, 
and allows for prediction of drug susceptibility of seven clinically used PIs 
from the HIV protease sequence. The model is based on 828 mutated HIV protease 
genome sequences and the experimental susceptibility data for the seven protease 
inhibitors measured by their ability to inhibit the replications of the 
respective mutated HIV variant in vitro; in total the model is based on 4794 
protease sequence-inhibitor combinations. For more information, please see:
