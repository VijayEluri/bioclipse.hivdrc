<h2>Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) model</h2>

This proteochemometric model allows for prediction of drug susceptibility of 
eight NRTIs (of which seven are in current clinical use) from the HIV protease sequence. 
The model is based on 728 mutated HIV reverse transcriptase genome sequences and 
the experimental susceptibility data for the eight NRTIs measured by their 
ability to inhibit the replications of the respective mutated HIV variant in 
vitro; in total the model is based on 4495 reverse transcriptase sequence-inhibitor 
combinations. For more information, please see:<p>
